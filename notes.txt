how to Create a vitrual environment in the terminal

1.  installl the library

mac: python3 -m pip install virtualenv

2.  create the virtual environment inside the server folder
cd server

mac: python3 -m venv venv

// this makes virtual environment (first venv) in folder "venv" (the second venv)


3. Launch the virtual environment
// you need to launch the virtual environment every time you work on the project
source venv/bin/activate

to de-activate the environment
mac:  deactivate


4.  Install Flask (flask is a python library like JQuery is a JS library) (inside the venv)
mac: python3 -m pip install flask
